The dataset, available at [this link](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/), is an open-source library of 42,306 movie plot summaries extracted from Wikipedia, aligned metadata extracted from Freebase, including
- Movie box office revenue, genre, release date, runtime, and language
- Character names and aligned information about the actors who portray them, including gender and estimated age at the time of the movie's release

Here are some interesting visualizations:

Some of our preliminary analysis consisted of exploring the ethnicities of actors and characters in the dataset to assess the feasibility of our project:

As can be seen in the figure above, which is initially surprising, most arab characters appear in Indian productions. This may be explained by the sheer amount of movies produced in Bollywood itself. In any case, when grouping by "western" productions and "all productions", Indian movies form the biggest counterweight to western movies.
