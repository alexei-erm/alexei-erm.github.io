The dataset, available at [this link](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/), is an open-source library of 42,306 movie plot summaries extracted from Wikipedia, aligned metadata extracted from Freebase, including
- Movie box office revenue, genre, release date, runtime, and language
- Character names and aligned information about the actors who portray them, including gender and estimated age at the time of the movie's release

Here are some interesting visualizations:

Some of our preliminary analysis consisted of exploring the ethnicities of actors and characters in the dataset to assess the feasibility of our project:
