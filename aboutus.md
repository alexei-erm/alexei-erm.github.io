Hello dear reader, here we wanted to quickly talk about the team behind this project, the PiñacolADA team! 
Contrary to popular belief, we are, in fact, not a piñacolada fanclub, but a Robert West fanclub. Unfortunately, that name was already taken, so we had to settle for our current name...
We are 5 EPFL Master's students, with four of us majoring in Mechanical engineering and (only) one being a (real) Data Science student. Let's quickly introduce ourselves:

### Alexei

Hey, I'm Alexei, I'm a mechanical engineering major specializing in control and robotics. I'm taking a data science minor which led me to take the ADA course in my 2nd year. I'm taking this minor and course because I really enjoy applied mathematics. 

My favorite Robert West quote is: *"It's over Anakin! I have the high ground!"*
