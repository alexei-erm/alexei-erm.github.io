Hello dear reader, here we wanted to quickly talk about the team behind this project, the Pi単acolADA team! 
Contrary to popular belief, we are, in fact, not a pi単acolada fanclub, but a Robert West fanclub. Unfortunately, that name was already taken, so we had to settle for the current one... I do think we all enjoy pi単acoladas, but not enough to create a fan club.
We are 5 EPFL Master's students, with four of us majoring in Mechanical engineering (Matteo, Filippo, Mohammad and Alexei) and (only) one being a (real) Data Science student (Yahya). We hope you enjoy our datastory!
